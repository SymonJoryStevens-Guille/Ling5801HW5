    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to provide a basic introduction to supervised learning in the context of a problem that has long been central to academic research and industry applications: __sentiment analysis__. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is built around the [Stanford Sentiment Treebank](http://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/) (SST), a widely-used resource for evaluating supervised NLU models, and one that provides rich linguistic representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're relatively new to supervised learning, we suggest you study the details of this notebook closely and follow the links to additional resources. If you're familiar with supervied learning, then you can focus right away on innovative feature representations and modeling. As of this writing, the state-of-the-art for the SST seems to be around 88% accuracy for the binary problem and 48% accuracy for the five-class problem. Perhaps you can best these numbers!\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis seems simple at first but turns out to exhibit all of the complexity of full natural language understanding. To see this, consider how your intuitions about the sentiment of the following sentences can change depending on perspective, social relationships, tone of voice, and other aspects of the context of utterance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There was an earthquake in LA.\n",
    "* The team failed the physical challenge. (We win/lose!)\n",
    "* They said it would be great. They were right/wrong.\n",
    "* Many consider the masterpiece bewildering, boring, slow-moving or annoying.\n",
    "* The party fat-cats are sipping their expensive, imported wines.\n",
    "* Oh, youâ€™re terrible!\n",
    "\n",
    "SST mostly steers around these challenges by including only focused, evaluative texts (sentences from movie reviews), but you should have them in mind if you consider new domains and applications for the ideas."
